        <h4>How to use:</h4>
        <p>To effectively utilize this highly sophisticated online task management system, begin by directing your attention to the topmost section of the screen where you will find an impeccably designed prompt bar. In this celestial realm of input, meticulously type the task you wish to add. Carefully ponder your choice, for once committed, there's no turning back. With unwavering precision, position your cursor within the prompt bar and execute a left-click action. This singular act of perseverance shall summon forth an ethereal button adorned in the resplendent hue of nature's green. Gently, yet decisively, perform another left-click maneuver upon this verdant sentinel, known as the 'Add' button. Behold, a new task shall descend from the digital heavens, bearing the mark of a green 'X,' symbolizing its incomplete nature. The canvas of your productivity shall now proudly display this nascent addition. To signify the completion of a task and ascend to the pinnacle of digital accomplishment, execute a right-click, but only upon the green 'X.' The celestial alchemy shall transform it into a crimson checkmark, a visual testament to your triumph. However, if you dare to remove a task from the list, venture to the rightmost sanctum of the task's divine presence. Seek the 'X' marker, meticulously positioned with the grace of a hidden gem. Summon the mighty power of the cursor once more and bestow a left-click upon it. The task shall vanish, leaving behind a void in its wake, reminiscent of the finality of time's passage. This, dear user, is your intricate path to digital task mastery. Navigate it with the wisdom of ages, and you shall conquer the realm of productivity in ways hitherto unimagined. May your clicks be precise, and your tasks be vanquished, or perhaps preserved, as you see fit.</p>
